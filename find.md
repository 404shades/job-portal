I am using AWS Organization. Now every month I would like to call certain APIs to get all the resources with their details of all child accounts. I am planning to use python for this. Where I should run this python script. I have 5,000 AWS Accounts and 300,000 resources.
To run a Python script that retrieves AWS resources from multiple child accounts within an AWS Organization, you can use AWS Lambda functions and Amazon CloudWatch Events to schedule the script to run periodically. Here is an overview of the steps you can follow:

Create an AWS Lambda function that contains your Python script. The function should be written to iterate through all child accounts in your AWS Organization and call the AWS APIs to retrieve the resources you want.

Configure the AWS Lambda function to use an IAM role with permissions to access the AWS APIs that you need. The IAM role should have permissions to assume roles in each child account and access the resources that you want to retrieve.

Create a CloudWatch Events rule that triggers the AWS Lambda function on a regular schedule. For example, you could schedule the function to run every month on the first day of the month.

Test the function to ensure that it retrieves the resources you want from all child accounts.

Monitor the function's execution and logs to ensure that it completes within a reasonable time frame and that it does not exceed any resource limits, such as API rate limits or memory limits.

Store the output of the function in a data store, such as Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, or Amazon DynamoDB, for further analysis and reporting.

By using AWS Lambda and CloudWatch Events, you can automate the process of retrieving resources from multiple AWS accounts within an AWS Organization, and scale the process to handle large numbers of accounts and resources.

Right now I am using Lambda but Lambda is timing out. So I am planning to use AWS batch and orchstrate batch jobs with Step function. Step function will have iterator job which will feed account ids of all child accounts. So parallely batch jobs can run to get the data
Yes, that sounds like a good approach. AWS Batch is designed to handle large-scale batch computing workloads and can help you parallelize and distribute your Python script across multiple instances to improve performance and avoid timeouts.

By using AWS Batch with a Step Function to orchestrate the batch jobs, you can automate the process of retrieving resources from multiple AWS accounts within an AWS Organization and ensure that the jobs are executed in parallel across multiple instances.

Here is a high-level overview of the steps you can follow:

Define a Step Function that takes in a list of AWS account IDs and invokes a batch job for each account ID.

Create an AWS Batch job definition that defines the container image, command, and environment variables required for your Python script to run.

Create an AWS Batch compute environment with a desired number of EC2 instances to execute your batch jobs. You can configure the compute environment to use Spot Instances to reduce costs.

Submit a job to the AWS Batch job queue for each AWS account ID that needs to be processed.

Monitor the progress of the batch jobs and log any errors or timeouts.

Store the output of the batch jobs in a data store, such as Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, or Amazon DynamoDB, for further analysis and reporting.

By using AWS Batch and Step Functions to parallelize your Python script across multiple instances, you can process large amounts of data efficiently and avoid timeouts.

Is it a good architecture or you have any better alternative to this
The architecture you've proposed using AWS Batch and Step Functions is a good solution for processing large amounts of data across multiple AWS accounts in parallel. This architecture is scalable, fault-tolerant, and can be automated using AWS services.

There are a few other alternatives you could consider depending on your use case:

AWS Glue: AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL (extract, transform, load) service that can crawl data sources, transform the data, and load it into a data store. You could use AWS Glue to crawl the AWS accounts and retrieve the resources, transform the data as needed, and then load it into a data store.

AWS Data Pipeline: AWS Data Pipeline is a fully managed data integration service that allows you to move data between different AWS services and on-premises data sources. You could use AWS Data Pipeline to retrieve the resources from the AWS accounts, process and transform the data, and then move it to a data store.

AWS Athena: AWS Athena is a serverless, interactive query service that allows you to query data stored in Amazon S3 using SQL. You could use AWS Athena to run ad-hoc queries on the data retrieved from the AWS accounts and generate reports as needed.

These services may be more suitable for certain use cases or data processing requirements. However, the architecture you've proposed using AWS Batch and Step Functions is a good solution for processing large amounts of data across multiple AWS accounts in parallel.




Rohan Malik
But I dont have any transformations to do. Job of each job is just to call boto3 apis and put them in a csv file. DO you think I require Glue/DataPIpeline or Athena for this
If your data processing requirements are as simple as retrieving data from AWS accounts using Boto3 APIs and storing the data in a CSV file, then you may not need AWS Glue, AWS Data Pipeline, or AWS Athena.

In this case, using AWS Batch and Step Functions to parallelize and automate the process of retrieving data from multiple AWS accounts is a good solution. You can define a batch job that runs a Python script that calls the Boto3 APIs to retrieve the data, and then stores the data in a CSV file.

You can use AWS Batch to create a compute environment with a group of EC2 instances that run your batch jobs in parallel, and use Step Functions to orchestrate and manage the execution of the batch jobs. This solution is scalable, fault-tolerant, and can be automated using AWS services.

Overall, the solution you've proposed using AWS Batch and Step Functions should be sufficient for your requirements, and you may not need to use AWS Glue, AWS Data Pipeline, or AWS Athena.

Now going in LLD of this. Can you help me in writing Python Scripts. I want to make my Python Code mantainable and scalable. I will have 200 different type of resources. So 200 different type of fnction scripts
Sure, I can give you some guidance on how to structure your Python code to make it maintainable and scalable.

When you have a large number of AWS resources to retrieve and store, it's important to write maintainable and scalable code that can handle the load efficiently. Here are some general guidelines to follow:

Use Python functions: Break your code into modular functions that each perform a specific task, such as retrieving data for a specific type of AWS resource. This will make your code easier to read, understand, and maintain.

Use object-oriented programming: Use object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create reusable classes and objects that encapsulate related functionality. This will make your code more modular, flexible, and easier to test and maintain.

Use configuration files: Store configuration data, such as AWS credentials and resource names, in external configuration files. This will make it easier to change the configuration data without having to modify the code.

Use logging: Use Python's logging module to log errors, warnings, and other information. This will help you debug your code and identify issues more easily.

Use exception handling: Use exception handling to handle errors and exceptions that may occur when retrieving data from AWS. This will help your code run more reliably and prevent it from crashing.

When you have 200 different types of AWS resources to retrieve and store, it's important to create a scalable solution that can handle the load efficiently. Here are some additional guidelines to follow:

Use parallel processing: Use Python's multiprocessing module to run multiple functions in parallel. This will help you retrieve data for multiple resources simultaneously, improving performance.

Use AWS Batch: Use AWS Batch to distribute your Python functions across multiple instances to further improve performance and scalability.

Use pagination: Many AWS APIs use pagination to limit the number of results returned in a single request. Use the pagination features provided by the AWS SDK to retrieve all the results for each resource type.

Use caching: Use a caching solution, such as Amazon ElastiCache or Redis, to store frequently accessed data in memory. This will improve performance by reducing the number of requests to AWS.

By following these guidelines, you can create maintainable and scalable Python code that can handle large-scale data processing tasks efficiently.




Rohan Malik
Can you describe code strucuture with the help of OOPS on how to maintain. Let me give you some example of my needs. One python function will be a EC2 based which will call describe_instance apis on all the ec2 instances of an account. Other is a RDS based which will call Boto3 api to get the details of all RDS Resources. Similarly There will be other resources as well. Now how to maintain this code
Sure, here's an example of how you could structure your code using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to make it more maintainable and scalable.

Create a base Resource class that defines common methods and properties for all resources:
python
Copy code
```
class Resource:
    def __init__(self, client):
        self.client = client
    
    def retrieve_data(self):
        raise NotImplementedError
```
Create a separate class for each resource type that inherits from the Resource class and implements its own retrieve_data() method:
python
Copy code
```
class EC2(Resource):
    def __init__(self, client):
        super().__init__(client)
    
    def retrieve_data(self):
        instances = self.client.describe_instances()
        # process data and store in CSV file
```
```
class RDS(Resource):
    def __init__(self, client):
        super().__init__(client)
    
    def retrieve_data(self):
        rds_instances = self.client.describe_db_instances()
        # process data and store in CSV file
```

# create other classes for other resource types as needed
Create a main function that retrieves a list of accounts and loops through each account, creating an instance of each resource class for that account and calling its retrieve_data() method:
python
Copy code
```
def main():
    accounts = get_accounts() # implement function to retrieve list of accounts
    for account in accounts:
        session = boto3.Session(
            region_name='us-east-1',
            aws_access_key_id=account['access_key'],
            aws_secret_access_key=account['secret_key']
        )
        ec2 = EC2(session.client('ec2'))
        ec2.retrieve_data()
        rds = RDS(session.client('rds'))
        rds.retrieve_data()
```

# create other resource instances and call retrieve_data() method as needed
This code structure separates the logic for each resource type into its own class, making it easier to add new resource types or modify existing ones without affecting other parts of the code. Additionally, it allows you to easily create multiple instances of each resource type for each account, which can be useful for parallel processing.

You can further optimize this code by using AWS Batch or other parallel processing techniques, such as using Python's multiprocessing module, to retrieve data for multiple resources simultaneously.




Rohan Malik
How will I give this script to aws batch. Example One aws batch will be responsible for runing one aws account jobs
To run the Python script on AWS Batch, you will need to create a Docker container that contains the Python environment and the code. Here are the general steps you can follow:

Create a Dockerfile that installs the required Python packages and copies your Python code into the container:
dockerfile
Copy code
```
FROM python:3.9

RUN pip install boto3 pandas

COPY script.py /app/script.py

WORKDIR /app

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "script.py"]
```
This Dockerfile installs boto3 and pandas packages and copies your script.py file into the /app directory of the container.

Build the Docker image and push it to a Docker registry such as Amazon ECR:
bash
Copy code
```
docker build -t my-script:latest .
docker tag my-script:latest <your-repo>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-script:latest
docker push <your-repo>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-script:latest
This builds the Docker image and pushes it to your Docker registry.
  ```

Create a job definition in AWS Batch that uses the Docker image:
json
Copy code
  ```
{
    "jobDefinitionName": "my-script",
    "type": "container",
    "containerProperties": {
        "image": "<your-repo>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-script:latest",
        "vcpus": 2,
        "memory": 2048,
        "command": [
            "python",
            "script.py",
            "--account_id",
            "$ACCOUNT_ID"
        ]
    }
}
  ```
This job definition specifies the Docker image and the command to run (python script.py --account_id $ACCOUNT_ID), where $ACCOUNT_ID is a placeholder for the actual AWS account ID.

Create a job queue and a job submission in AWS Batch:
json
Copy code
  ```
{
    "jobQueueName": "my-queue",
    "priority": 1,
    "computeEnvironmentOrder": [
        {
            "order": 1,
            "computeEnvironment": "my-env"
        }
    ]
}

{
    "jobName": "my-job",
    "jobDefinition": "my-script",
    "jobQueue": "my-queue",
    "parameters": {
        "ACCOUNT_ID": "123456789012"
    }
}
  ```
This creates a job queue and a job submission that uses the my-script job definition and specifies the account ID as a parameter.

Use a Step Function to orchestrate the jobs for each AWS account:
You can create a Step Function that loops through each AWS account and submits a job for each one:

json
Copy code
  ```
{
  "StartAt": "Loop",
  "States": {
    "Loop": {
      "Type": "Map",
      "InputPath": "$.accounts",
      "ItemsPath": "$",
      "MaxConcurrency": 10,
      "Iterator": {
        "StartAt": "SubmitJob",
        "States": {
          "SubmitJob": {
            "Type": "Task",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:states:::batch:submitJob.sync",
            "Parameters": {
              "JobName": "my-job",
              "JobDefinition": "my-script",
              "JobQueue": "my-queue",
              "Parameters": {
                "ACCOUNT_ID.$": "$$.Map.Item.Value"
              }
            },
            "End": true
          }
        }
      },
      "End": true
    }
  }
}
  ```
This Step Function uses a Map state to loop through each AWS account, and for each account, it submits a job using the `SubmitJob




Rohan Malik
thats what my question is if AWS batch expects a single python script to run. How do I mantain my code ?
You can structure your codebase in a way that allows you to have a single entrypoint script that can call multiple functions based on user input or configuration. Here's one way you could do it:

Create a module named resources which will contain one module for each type of AWS resource you want to query. For example, ec2.py, rds.py, etc. Each module should have a function named get_resources() which will return a list of dictionaries representing the resources.

In your entrypoint script, you can define a dictionary mapping resource types to their respective modules and functions. For example:

python
Copy code
```
import resources

RESOURCE_FUNCTIONS = {
    'ec2': resources.ec2.get_resources,
    'rds': resources.rds.get_resources,
    # Add more resource types as needed
}
Parse the user input or configuration to determine which resource type(s) to query, and then call the appropriate function(s). For example:
python
Copy code
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('resource_type', nargs='+', choices=RESOURCE_FUNCTIONS.keys(),
                    help='Type(s) of AWS resources to query')
args = parser.parse_args()

for resource_type in args.resource_type:
    resources = RESOURCE_FUNCTIONS[resource_type]()
 ```
    # Write the resources to a CSV file or upload them to S3 or perform any other necessary processing
When submitting a job to AWS Batch, you can pass the desired resource type(s) as command-line arguments to the container, and the entrypoint script will take care of calling the appropriate functions.
By structuring your code in this way, you can easily add or remove resource types and their corresponding functions without having to modify the entrypoint script.




Rohan Malik
I am not able to understand this. Can you help with more detaild description
Sure, here's a more detailed description:

Create a module named resources which will contain one module for each type of AWS resource you want to query. For example, ec2.py, rds.py, etc. Each module should have a function named get_resources() which will return a list of dictionaries representing the resources.
python
Copy code
  ```
# resources/ec2.py

import boto3

def get_resources():
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    response = ec2.describe_instances()
    instances = []
    for reservation in response['Reservations']:
        for instance in reservation['Instances']:
            instances.append({
                'InstanceId': instance['InstanceId'],
                'InstanceType': instance['InstanceType'],
                'LaunchTime': instance['LaunchTime'].strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'),
                # Add more fields as needed
            })
    return instances
 ```
python
Copy code
  ```
# resources/rds.py

import boto3

def get_resources():
    rds = boto3.client('rds')
    response = rds.describe_db_instances()
    db_instances = []
    for db_instance in response['DBInstances']:
        db_instances.append({
            'DBInstanceIdentifier': db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'],
            'DBInstanceClass': db_instance['DBInstanceClass'],
            'Engine': db_instance['Engine'],
            # Add more fields as needed
        })
    return db_instances
In your entrypoint script, you can define a dictionary mapping resource types to their respective modules and functions. For example:
python
Copy code
import argparse
import importlib
import resources

RESOURCE_FUNCTIONS = {
    'ec2': importlib.import_module('resources.ec2').get_resources,
    'rds': importlib.import_module('resources.rds').get_resources,
    # Add more resource types as needed
}
  ```
Parse the user input or configuration to determine which resource type(s) to query, and then call the appropriate function(s). For example:
python
Copy code
  ```
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('resource_type', nargs='+', choices=RESOURCE_FUNCTIONS.keys(),
                    help='Type(s) of AWS resources to query')
args = parser.parse_args()

for resource_type in args.resource_type:
    resources = RESOURCE_FUNCTIONS[resource_type]()
  ```
    # Write the resources to a CSV file or upload them to S3 or perform any other necessary processing
When submitting a job to AWS Batch, you can pass the desired resource type(s) as command-line arguments to the container, and the entrypoint script will take care of calling the appropriate functions.
By structuring your code in this way, you can easily add or remove resource types and their corresponding functions without having to modify the entrypoint script.




Rohan Malik
This involves multiple python files. Will AWS batch be able to call a entry point which will in turn call all these functions from different python files
Yes, AWS Batch can run a Python entry point script that imports and calls functions from multiple Python files. Here's an example of how you could structure your files:

main.py: This is the entry point for your AWS Batch job. It should import the resource-specific modules and call their get_resources() functions.
python
Copy code
  ```
import argparse
import csv
import importlib

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('--resource-type', required=True, help='Type of AWS resource to query')
parser.add_argument('--output-path', required=True, help='Path to output CSV file')
args = parser.parse_args()

module_name = f'resources.{args.resource_type}'
module = importlib.import_module(module_name)
resources = module.get_resources()

with open(args.output_path, 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = resources[0].keys()
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerows(resources)
resources/: This directory contains the resource-specific modules. Each module should have a get_resources() function that returns a list of resource dictionaries.
```
  python
Copy code
  ```
# resources/ec2.py
import boto3

def get_resources():
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    response = ec2.describe_instances()
    instances = []
    for reservation in response['Reservations']:
        for instance in reservation['Instances']:
            instances.append({
                'InstanceId': instance['InstanceId'],
                'InstanceType': instance['InstanceType'],
                'LaunchTime': instance['LaunchTime'].strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'),
                # Add more fields as needed
            })
    return instances
  ```
python
Copy code
  ```
# resources/rds.py
import boto3

def get_resources():
    rds = boto3.client('rds')
    response = rds.describe_db_instances()
    db_instances = []
    for db_instance in response['DBInstances']:
        db_instances.append({
            'DBInstanceIdentifier': db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'],
            'DBInstanceClass': db_instance['DBInstanceClass'],
            'Engine': db_instance['Engine'],
            # Add more fields as needed
        })
    return db_instances
  ```
When you submit a job to AWS Batch, you can specify the --resource-type and --output-path arguments to the entry point script. AWS Batch will then launch a Docker container that runs your script and passes in the specified arguments.

For example, to query EC2 instances and save the results to an S3 bucket:

css
Copy code
  ```
aws batch submit-job --job-name ec2-query --job-queue my-job-queue --job-definition my-job-definition \
    --container-overrides 'command=["python", "main.py", "--resource-type", "ec2", "--output-path", "s3://my-bucket/ec2-instances.csv"]'
  ```
  
  
 Yes, you can apply SOLID principles and design patterns to make your code more maintainable and scalable. Here's an example of how you could use the factory pattern to create resource-specific clients that follow the single responsibility principle:

main.py: This is the entry point for your AWS Batch job. It should create a resource client using the ResourceClientFactory and call its get_resources() method

```python
import argparse
import csv
from resource_client_factory import ResourceClientFactory

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('--resource-type', required=True, help='Type of AWS resource to query')
parser.add_argument('--output-path', required=True, help='Path to output CSV file')
args = parser.parse_args()

factory = ResourceClientFactory()
client = factory.create_client(args.resource_type)
resources = client.get_resources()

with open(args.output_path, 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = resources[0].keys()
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerows(resources)
```

2. resource_client_factory.py: This module contains the ResourceClientFactory class that creates resource-specific clients based on the resource type.
```python
import boto3

from ec2_client import EC2Client
from rds_client import RDSClient

class ResourceClientFactory:
    def create_client(self, resource_type):
        if resource_type == 'ec2':
            ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
            return EC2Client(ec2)
        elif resource_type == 'rds':
            rds = boto3.client('rds')
            return RDSClient(rds)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f'Invalid resource type: {resource_type}')
```
3.resource_client.py: This module contains the ResourceClient abstract class that defines the interface for resource-specific clients.
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class ResourceClient(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_resources(self):
        pass

```
4. ec2_client.py: This module contains the EC2Client class that implements the ResourceClient interface for EC2 instances.
```python
from resource_client import ResourceClient

class EC2Client(ResourceClient):
    def __init__(self, ec2):
        self.ec2 = ec2

    def get_resources(self):
        response = self.ec2.describe_instances()
        instances = []
        for reservation in response['Reservations']:
            for instance in reservation['Instances']:
                instances.append({
                    'InstanceId': instance['InstanceId'],
                    'InstanceType': instance['InstanceType'],
                    'LaunchTime': instance['LaunchTime'].strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'),
                    # Add more fields as needed
                })
        return instances
```
5. rds_client.py: This module contains the RDSClient class that implements the ResourceClient interface for RDS instances.
```python
from resource_client import ResourceClient

class RDSClient(ResourceClient):
    def __init__(self, rds):
        self.rds = rds

    def get_resources(self):
        response = self.rds.describe_db_instances()
        db_instances = []
        for db_instance in response['DBInstances']:
            db_instances.append({
                'DBInstanceIdentifier': db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'],
                'DBInstanceClass': db_instance['DBInstanceClass'],
                'Engine': db_instance['Engine'],
                # Add more fields as needed
            })
        return db_instances
```
6.This design allows you to add new resource types and clients easily without modifying the main.py script or existing clients. To add
