Highlist more on the issues that they will be facing because of their current approach and they certainly have to move to the new plan as soon as poosible
Sure, here are some additional issues your startup may face due to their current approach and why it's essential to move to the new plan as soon as possible:

Inability to Rollback Deployments: Without version control and automated deployment processes, it can be challenging to rollback deployments if something goes wrong. This can lead to prolonged downtime, lost revenue, and a negative impact on customer experience.

Inefficient Use of Time and Resources: Manually copying and pasting code for each deployment is time-consuming and inefficient. Your team members could be spending their time on more value-adding tasks, such as developing new features or optimizing existing ones.

Lack of Visibility and Control: Without proper version control and automated deployment processes, it's difficult to track changes and understand who made them. This can lead to confusion, errors, and inconsistent code.

Difficulty in Scaling: As your startup grows, you'll likely need to deploy more Lambda functions to handle increased traffic or new features. Doing this manually becomes increasingly complex and time-consuming, making it difficult to scale your infrastructure effectively.

Security Risks: Manually copying and pasting code for each deployment can introduce security risks, such as exposing secrets or credentials. Using an automated deployment process, such as the proposed Terraform and GitLab pipelines, can reduce the likelihood of such risks.

Difficulty in Collaboration: Without proper version control and automated deployment processes, collaboration between team members can be challenging, leading to inconsistencies in the codebase and increased risk of errors.

In summary, your startup's current approach to deploying AWS Lambda functions in Python has numerous flaws and future issues that can have a negative impact on business operations, customer experience, and security. It's essential to move to the new plan as soon as possible to reduce risk, improve efficiency, and scale your infrastructure effectively.

Highlight the areas on how cost can be saved with new approach
Certainly! Here are some ways that your startup can save costs with the new approach of using Terraform and GitLab pipelines for deploying AWS Lambda functions in Python:

Reduced Time Spent on Deployments: The manual deployment process can be time-consuming, especially as the number of Lambda functions increases. Using Terraform and GitLab pipelines for automated deployment can significantly reduce the time spent on deployments, freeing up time and resources to focus on other value-adding tasks.

Efficient Resource Management: Terraform allows you to manage infrastructure as code, making it easier to manage and optimize resources. You can easily scale up or down resources based on demand, reducing the risk of overspending on idle resources.

Improved Visibility and Control: With proper version control and automated deployment processes, you can gain better visibility and control over your infrastructure. This can help you identify and address inefficiencies and overspending, reducing unnecessary costs.

Cost-Effective Scalability: As your startup grows, you'll need to scale your infrastructure to handle increased traffic and new features. Terraform allows for cost-effective scaling of infrastructure, ensuring you're not overspending on unnecessary resources.

Avoidance of Human Error: Manually copying and pasting code for each deployment can introduce human error, leading to costly mistakes. Using an automated deployment process can reduce the likelihood of such errors, saving costs associated with fixing errors and downtime.

In summary, using Terraform and GitLab pipelines for deploying AWS Lambda functions in Python can help your startup save costs by reducing time spent on deployments, managing resources more efficiently, improving visibility and control, enabling cost-effective scalability, and avoiding costly human errors.

is it difficult to move to manual deployements to terraform deployements using gitlab
Moving from manual deployments to Terraform deployments using GitLab can require some effort and expertise, but it's not overly difficult. Here are some steps you can take to make the transition smoother:

Assess Your Existing Infrastructure: Before you start moving to Terraform, you should have a clear understanding of your existing infrastructure. This includes understanding the current AWS Lambda functions you have, their dependencies, and how they interact with other parts of your infrastructure.

Learn Terraform: You or your team members will need to learn how to use Terraform to manage your infrastructure. Terraform is a powerful tool, but it has a learning curve. You can start by reading the official Terraform documentation, watching tutorials, and joining Terraform communities to learn from experienced users.

Develop Terraform Code: Once you understand Terraform, you can begin writing code to define your infrastructure. This includes creating modules for AWS Lambda functions, defining their dependencies, and setting up deployment pipelines using GitLab.

Test and Deploy: Before deploying to production, it's important to test your Terraform code in a non-production environment. This ensures that everything works as expected before you move to production. You can use staging environments or separate AWS accounts to test your Terraform code.

Monitor and Iterate: After deploying your infrastructure using Terraform, it's important to monitor and iterate as needed. You can use monitoring tools to track the performance and cost of your infrastructure and make adjustments to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

In summary, while moving from manual deployments to Terraform deployments using GitLab may require some effort and expertise, it's not overly difficult. By following these steps, you can make the transition smoother and realize the benefits of automated deployments and infrastructure as code.

I already know terraform and gitlab ci/cd. So how much time should I mention to my time for migration
The amount of time required to migrate from manual deployments to Terraform deployments using GitLab will depend on a number of factors, including the size and complexity of your infrastructure, the number of AWS Lambda functions you have, and the current state of your automation processes.

However, since you already have experience with Terraform and GitLab CI/CD, you should have a head start in the migration process. Assuming that you have a good understanding of your existing infrastructure, the following are some general time estimates to consider for migrating to Terraform deployments using GitLab:

Initial Assessment and Planning: 1-2 weeks. During this phase, you'll need to assess your existing infrastructure, identify AWS Lambda functions to be migrated, create a migration plan, and estimate the time and resources required for the migration.

Code Development: 2-4 weeks. This phase involves writing Terraform code to define your infrastructure, including creating modules for AWS Lambda functions, setting up dependencies, and creating deployment pipelines using GitLab.

Testing and Deployment: 1-2 weeks. Before deploying to production, it's important to test your Terraform code in a non-production environment to ensure that everything works as expected. This phase also involves deploying your code to production and monitoring for any issues.

Iteration and Optimization: Ongoing. After the initial migration, you'll need to continually monitor and optimize your infrastructure to ensure it's efficient, cost-effective, and meets your business needs.

Keep in mind that these are rough estimates, and the actual time required for your migration may vary depending on your specific circumstances. Additionally, you may want to allocate additional time for training team members on the new infrastructure and deployment processes.
